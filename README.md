	I decided to analyze Jersey City bicycle data from November 2018 to April 2019. I chose this time period so that I can analyze all of the biking done in the winter as well as a little bit of time before and after winter. I did 2018 to 2019 instead of 2019 to 2020 because I wanted to analyze a time period that was not impacted by Coronavirus. I used Tableau to conduct my analysis. I put csv files of all Jersey City bicycle data from November 2019 to April 2019 into my Tableau workbook. I created a Tableau Public Workbook for this assignment. 
	I looked at a gender by count in Tableau by putting the gender table into columns and putting the count of the bike id table into rows. There are many more male bicycle riders than female bicycle riders in this dataset. This makes sense as in general males tend to ride bicycles more than females. I looked at most popular locations. The most popular locations in this data set are near Grand Street. This makes sense as there are a lot of streets in that area where people are able to ride their bicycles.
	A chart was created that shows the top 10 stations in this dataset. These are the stations where people are bicycling the most. The most popular station is the Grove St PATH station, which makes sense as it is the train station in Jersey City that most people use. After analyzing peak hours in winter months by putting the hour of the start time in columns and the count of the bike id in rows, I found that the times at which people are bicyling the most in this data set are 8AM and 6PM. This makes sense, as some people may be biking to and from work, and other people may go biking as a form of exercise before and after work.
